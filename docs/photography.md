## Basic Principles

## Food Photography

Use photography to show food in ways that are crafted and artisan. People purchase food based on visuals, so set it on an appetizing background and use low-aperture photography to isolate the food on a blurry background. Don't ever show raw ingredients - that might be interesting to your chef, but none of your insta followers want to see hunks of raw meat. Instead, always show food that is perfectly plated and paired with a good drink.
You should never show food in groups or in ways that look manufactured in bulk. Always show food on its own plate. If you show a table with multiple entrees, vary which entrees are visible.

## Drink Photography

Set ingredients in the photo so that viewers can start to picture the taste of the drink. Is it a cinnamon drink? Place a cinnamon clove next to the glass to give the viewer an idea of test. Grapefruit-infused citrus drink? Show a chopped grapefruit next to the drink to make the mouth water. Occasionally show a drink in somebody's hand.

You should never show drinks in groups or in ways that seem manufactured in bulk. Always show the drinks on their own, rather than in rows of glasses. If you take a picture with multiple people, feel free to make them different specialty drinks and show them clinking glasses with different options. 

## Interior Photography

You have two options when photographing the interior: either completely empty, or bustling and filled with life. Either show your space completely clean, void of people, and ready for business. Or show it with the room filled with life, lots of tables full, and showcase the environment being filled with a crowd of pleased diners. When you show a space that just has one or two tables full, you'll be giving the unhealthy visual of a dining experience that is simply "meh."
