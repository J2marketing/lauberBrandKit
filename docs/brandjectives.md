## Brandjectives Overview

So what are brandjectives™?

At J2, Brandjectives™ are how we communicate the over-arching themes of a brand. Brandjectives are both adjectives that describe your business, and objectives for your marketing. Aim to fulfill every brandjective with every piece of marketing material that you create. 

## Modern

The Lauber is a modern, classy restaurant. . We commit ourselves to sleek, beautiful design. Our interior space is expensive and crisp. With modern fixtures and luxurious finishes, our building leans into a modern feel. 

## Industrial

Our logo and identity pay homage to the history of the building. Joseph Charles Lauber was a industrial pioneer who built his success in the sheet metal industry using raw, honest, hard work. Though a modern restaurant, we tip our hat to the industrial past of the building. We're putting a high quality interior into a historical sheet metal building - the result is a building that can only be described as Modern Industrial. 

## We've Got our Shit Together

As all good hosts do, we hold ourselves to higher standard than our guests. We don't scoff at sneakers here. But our space is a well-oiled machine. We get food out on-time. We're clean and fresh.. We have a hospitable environment. We welcome all. And we're damn good at staying organized. That's the only way we can truly keep guests excited with the quality of our dining experience. 

## Crafted

Our dining experience is anything but cookie-cutter. Our menu feels home-grown. It's comprised of signature selections, unique sauces, specialty drinks, and artisan pizzas. You can grab a Guinness if you want, but we're going to encourage you to try a craft beer, because we want you to enjoy something special. 

## Fun

We can't forget about how necessary it is for our guests to kick back and have a good time. Whether they schedule a business meeting over dinner or drop by for a late night beer, our guests will feel relaxed, welcome, and appreciated. The Lauber is the perfect space to feel warm, safe, and at home. We want guests to feel like this is the perfect spot to unwind.
